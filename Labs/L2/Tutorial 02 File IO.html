<p class="segment-header">Description:</p>

<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to familarize you with some simple file I/O in C++ that would be appropriate for assignment #1. Also to get you working with some of the capabilities of the <span class="code">&lt;string&gt;</span> library.</p>
<p>You will need to do some research regarding <span class="code">&lt;fstream&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;string&gt;</span>. Look at the information provided at</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/fstream">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/fstream/</a></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/</a></p>
<p>Do some google-ing and experiments before coming to the tutorial.</p>
<p class="red">This tutorial is meant to be started as homework. You will not be able to finish if you only start working on it at your tutorial session.</p>

<h2>Preliminary: Writing and Reading Text Files</h2>
<p>Open the file <span class="code">writeFileMain.cpp </span>in an editor and study the code. Compile and run it and get familiar with what it does. It should prompt your for some information and then write it to a text file. Run the code and then see that the text file <span class="code">phoneData.txt</span> was created and check its contents.</p>
<p>The demo code is using C++11 <span class="code">&lt;string&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;fstream&gt;</span> features. You will have to compile it with <span class="code">-std=c++11</span> option:</p>
<p><span class="code">g++ -g -Wall -std=c++11 writeFileMain.cpp</span><span class="code"></span></p>
<p>My output looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/01WriteFile.png" width="909" height="257"></p>
<p>The <span class="code">writeFileMainAlternative.cpp</span> file shows an input technique which is much debated. Many books show it as an example of how to read from <span class="code">cin</span> or a file, but many feel it is inherently unsafe and is, in fact,  an example of how NOT to do it. Have a look and see what you think. What potential problems do you see?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next open the file <span class="code">readFileMain.cpp</span> and examine its code. The program reads the lines of text in the file <span class="code">songtitles.txt</span>. These are the song titles from a <span class="code">beatles.db</span> database similar to the test data being used in assignment #1. Compile and run the program. It should open the file, read it contents and print the song titles to the console. My output looked like the following:</p>
<p><img src="images/02ReadFile.png" width="896" height="279"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Problem 1) Writing Files</h2>
<p>Create a new file <span class="code">main.cpp</span> that combines   <span class="code">readFileMain.cpp</span> and <span class="code">writeFileMain.cpp</span> so that the program does the following.</p>
<p>1) The program should prompt the user for an input file name and then prompt the user for an output file name.</p>
<p>2) The program should read the lines of text from the input file and then write the lines of text to the output file.</p>
<p>When it has run the output file should be a copy of the input file. Test this using the <span class="code">songtitles.txt</span> file as the input file.</p>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<hr>
<h2>Problem 2) A String Utility Function</h2>
<p>You will notice that the song titles in the <span class="code">songtitles.txt</span> file are all lower case. We want to write a function to convert them to all upper case.</p>
<p>Here is one possible solution for a function added to <span class="code">main.cpp</span>: (I wrote this function after researching the <span class="code">&lt;string&gt;</span> library and some c utility functions that are also included with c++. You should do some googling about iterating through strings and converting characters.</p>
<pre>

string toUpperCase(string str){
	string s;
	for(char & c : str){
		s.append(1,toupper(c));
	}
	return s;
}
</pre>
<p>Modify your main program so that instead of just writing the original song title to the output file like this:</p>
<p class="code">file &lt;&lt; input &lt;&lt; endl;</p>
<p>instead you write the titles in uppercase   like this:</p>
<p class="code">file &lt;&lt; toUpperCase(input) &lt;&lt; endl;</p>
<p>Test your code to see that the output file now has the song titles in upper case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h2>Problem 3) Title Case</h2>
<p>Now we get to the real intention. Based on your research about strings write a function that will convert the song titles to &quot;title case&quot;. Title case has the following requirements:</p>
<p>1) Each word in the title should start with a capital letter and the remaining letters in the word should be lower case.</p>
<p>2) Any song that starts with &quot;The &quot; should have the &quot;The &quot; moved to the end of the title. For example &quot;The Girl From Ipanema&quot; should become &quot;Girl From Ipanema, The&quot;.</p>
<p>Write a function <span class="code">string toTitleCase(string str){...}</span> that does this conversion.</p>
<p>Test it with your program an confirm that the output file now contains the song titles in title case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h2>Problem 4) A String Utilities Class</h2>
<p>Finally we don't want our code filling up with non-object-oriented global functions. We want to create a <span class="code">StrUtils</span> class that will provide some string utility functions. For now just our <span class="code">toUpperCase()</span> and <span class="code">toTitleCase()</span> functions.</p>
<p>Create two files <span class="code">str_utils.h</span> and <span class="code">str_utils.cpp</span> to serve this purpose.</p>
<p>Here is what the two files might look like with just the <span class="code">toUpperCase() </span>function represented. </p>
<pre>
//str_utils.h
#include &lt;string&gt;

using namespace std;

class StrUtils{
	public:
	static string toUpperCase(string str);
};
</pre>

<pre>
//str_utls.cpp
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include "str_utils.h"

using namespace std;


string StrUtils::toUpperCase(string str){
	string s;
	for(char & c : str){
		s.append(1,toupper(c));
	}
	return s;
}
</pre>
<p>It is IMPORTANT to notice the <span class="code">toUpperCase</span> function is declared to be <span class="code">static</span>. That means we can invoke the function by itself and not on some object. An object, or instance, method <span class="code">toUpperCase()</span> would have to be invoked like this:</p>
<p class="code">someObject.toUpperCase(myString);</p>
<p>But a <span class="code">static</span> method of class <span class="code">StrUtils</span> would be invoked like this:</p>
<p class="code">StrUtils::toUpperCase(myString);</p>
<p>So your use of this function in your code might now look like this:</p>
<p class="code">file &lt;&lt; StrUtils::toUpperCase(input) &lt;&lt; endl;</p>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<p>Make the required changes to <span class="code">main.cpp</span> (which would include <span class="code">str_utils.h</span> now) and recompile and run the code. Remember you will now have to have both <span class="code">main.cpp</span> and <span class="code">str_utils.cpp</span> compiled with your <span class="code">g++</span> command (like we learned about in Tutorial 01).</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Optional) Challenge Problem</h2>
<p>If you look at the <span class="code">&lt;string&gt;</span> reference at <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/</a> you can find member functions, or methods, <span class="code">size()</span> and <span class="code">length()</span>. According to the reference they both return the same thing: the length of the string <span class="black-bold">in bytes</span> (not in characters). Curiously there appears to be no method that returns the number of characters in a <span class="code">&lt;string&gt;</span> object. What's up with that? Can you explain what the issue is? Can you write a string utility method that does return the number of characters in a string?</p>
