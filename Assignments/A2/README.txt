Compilation Cmd:
	- To compile, you will need to access the respected directory all the files are located in.
        cd src 
		- Once you are in the respected directory, you'll need to run the Makefile.
			- make
		- Once you ran the Make, it'll create an updated version of all the object files.
			- It'll create a big object file called mytunes, which is all the program's object files 
			into one.
				- Run...
					- ./mytunes
					- .read insert_beatles_tracks_rev1.txt

To clean:
make clean
